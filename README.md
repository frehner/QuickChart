QuickChart
==========
QuickChart is an AngularJS and D3.js project that allows a user to enter any amount of data points that they want (data points are text labels and numbers) and then gives them the option to see those datapoints charted in several different ways (horizontal bar chart, vertical bar chart, pie chart are currently functional, with the desire to add more in the future if I ever get time).

Background Information
==========
This project served as a way to get my feet wet in both AngularJS and D3.js.  As such, it has room for improvement in several areas but with my current time constraints I decided to publish this as it is and plan to come back to improve it when I can.
